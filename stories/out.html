	<h1> Out </h1>
	<p>"I find it hard to believe Jastra's blossoms aren't blooming. She's been spending SO much time gardening." A voice whispered conspiratorially.
	</p><p>Sidhion leaned his head on a palm when his mother had turned away as he listened to the gossip firing through the dinner hall. He couldn't care less who was sleeping with who, but he knew it was important. 'Smile big and forget nothing,' his mother often told him. But he still felt a bit young to listening in these inner circles and having his opinion actually matter.
	</p><p>His eyes traveled to their favorite spot of the evening. Saeran, the elder of the Naïlo sons, was seated at the table a few seats to the left, with his younger sibling stabbing at his salad and wiping his nose with his sleeve. Revolting.
	</p><p>"Tyson. Tyson, no," Saeran whispered to his younger brother. It was exasperating how the room was full of earsplitting secrets and his own kin glowered disrespectfully. He was so glad to be deemed mature enough to sit in on formal dinners, and yet, he had to also be here with his excuse for a brother. Saeran heaved a sigh and gave up on Tyson's bad manners. Maybe if he paid attention, he could glean more details of the Teinlasse's new business venture. He looked away, catching the gaze of his oldest friend, seated not too far away. Half of Saeran's mouth twitched into a smile as he thought that Sidhion was here too, at least.
	</p><p>Saeran suddenly met his eyes and Sidhion had to keep the goofy grin off his face at his friend's smile. Instead he looked pointedly at Phantyni nearby, laughing loudly at another man's comment, and then rolled his eyes and popped a grape delicately into his mouth.
	</p><p>Some girls found Tyson Naïlo’s ruggedness endearing, but Saeran was the devilishly handsome heartbreaker. A god of eloquence, and Sidhion's closest friend. He was so confident, so full of life and mischief. Sidhion sipped his wine idly as he thought about the odd epiphany he'd come to last week. At first, it seemed silly. Utterly fictitious. But Sidhion knew things had been different ever since the Lamara festival four months ago that Saeran was crushed he was too young to attend. Sidhion liked Saeran. A lot.

But Sidhion knew things had been different ever since the Lamara festival four months ago that Saeran was crushed he was too young to attend. Sidhion liked Saeran. A lot.
	</p><p>As the dessert was brought out, it would permissible to stand and walk around, so Sidhion stood up and meandered over a few chairs to sit with the Naïlo’s as the elders mingled.
	</p><p>A sip of elderberry juice found Sidhion standing over the Naïlo brothers' table, and Saeran exaggerated a smile. "Sidhion. My friend," he ignored Tyson completely and raised his eyebrows, as if to say, 'Did you hear of Soraleigha's affair?'
	</p><p>Sidhion rolled his shoulder, as if to say 'Saw it coming a mile away. If you think that's news, wait until you see Holone. Who do you think the father could be? Some are saying her cousin.' He sat down in the empty seat next to Saeran and said easily, "It's great to see the two of you. Have you killed your salad yet, Tyson?"
	</p><p>Tyson shot a glare at Sidhion, attacking his dish with exaggerated fervor.
	</p><p>Saeran relaxed his stiff posture and sat back. 'To be expected from such classless filth.' He wondered why his father insisted on bringing Tyson to these dinners when he was obviously not fit to represent his family yet. If Saeran had his way, it could just be he and Sidhion reveling in this exchange of valuable information. "I am pleased to see you, as well."
	</p><p>"How have things been in House Naïlo?" He loved the way even relaxed, Saeran's posture was reputably perfect. He smiled cheerfully. Saeran was pleased to see him. Even if it wasn't necessarily in the same way he was pleased to see Saeran. A beautiful cake was placed in front of them, and both Sidhion and Tyson's eyes lit up comically. Sidhion deftly pulled the knife out of Tyson's grip and served him a piece. He had a feeling the dessert would be butchered otherwise. He started to primp his hair to say, 'it's such a burden to be a woman' but thought better of it at the last second, and just fixed his hair.
	</p><p>"Quite well. Our lilies are blooming wonderfully this season." Shoving his plate in the midst of their small tussle would be impetuous, rude even. As Sidhion finished cutting his own cake, Saeran leaned forward to gently take the knife from his hand. He would not be showing weakness by letting Sidhion serve him.
	</p><p>"That's-" Saeran's fingers brushed his own, and he had to cover up the blush that worked its way onto his youthful cheeks. He should have guessed Saeran would insist on doing it himself. "That's lovely to hear. I believe mother was just talking about coming by to see them," he said, sounding perfectly natural in spite of his feelings.
	</p><p>Saeran cut himself a modest slice with deft hands. Something made Sidhion falter, and it wasn't lost on Saeran. He scanned the room briefly to see if there was perhaps a new female in their midst. Was there some young minx nearby making Sidhion nearly loose his composure that he'd yet neglected to confide in his dearest friend about? <i>Scandalous</i> "We're always happy to have you."
	</p><p>"You're sure I won't overstay my welcome?" Happy to have him. He almost laughed at Tyson's expression of 'never come over ever'. That child had some serious angst issues. He looked over his shoulder to follow Saeran's gaze. Was there something he'd missed? He looked at Saeran questioningly. Had he been too obvious? A friend shouldn't be harboring secret feelings for another friend. They told each other everything. He should tell Saeran. He took a bite of cake with new resolve. He would tell him tonight, after dinner.
	</p><p>"Sidhion," Saeran chided with a charming smile, as he tucked a napkin into his collar. "You know we could never tire of you." It was obvious from Tyson's reaction that what Saeran meant was 'I' not 'we', but in essence it was true. Mylaela would never turn away her dear friend's son, and in truth Saeran could always find a way to while away the hours when he was with Sidhion. Of all the pleasantries uttered tonight, this one was closest to true. The cake was superb.
	</p><p>Sidhion's eyes glittered. "Nor I you." He meant the entire Naïlo family, but it came off sounding more like he meant Saeran alone. Suddenly conscious of that fact, he shoved slightly too large a mouthful of cake into his mouth to be proper and regretted it immediately. He laid his fork on his plate in a way to say, 'excuse me', and stood to step outside where he could compose himself. Every step away from Saeran was like a needle through his heart.
	</p><p><i>That was odd.</i> Saeran thought as he watched his friend stride out of the dining hall with too much cake in his mouth. The dinner was almost over, and Sidhion wasn't one to miss out on closing statements. As the ceremony concluded and guests were allowed to mingle and depart, Saeran ached to discuss poor Turin and his obviously depleting investments, but he realized Tyson didn't care for such gossip and Sidhion was not present to see the sweat on the nobleman's brow that told the whole story. Silently blowing an exasperated sigh through his nose, Saeran untucked his bib and stood from the table. "I trust you can find your own way, brother?" Without waiting for a reply he strode out after Sidhion through the glass doors he had disappeared through.
	</p><p>Tyson snorted at Saeran's 'fancy' talk and grabbed the plate that Saeran left behind. The adults who saw clicked their tongues distastefully, but no matter. Everyone knew Tyson was different. Mylaela appeared to be quite engaged in a conversation that was facing the opposite direction, but her pale cheeks made it apparent she'd noticed as well.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Outside, Sidhion had let his face show his upset, as he hadn't thought anyone would come out to see it, and his breathing quickened as he chewed and beat himself up. Why did he have to act like such a fool in front of the very object of his desires? Saeran was more than that. He was his friend, his other half, his soul mate. He could see that now. He only wondered why Saeran didn't see it as well, because he certainly hadn't said anything if he had. Not to mention it was clear he had a predilection for women...
	</p><p>Saeran emerged on the patio and closed the door behind him quietly. Now that he saw Sidhion plainly, he knew there was something bothering him besides a large bite of cake. <i>What are you hiding from me?</i> Saeran cleared his throat audibly and looked at his friend with an inquiring look.
	</p><p>The moment he heard the signature throat clearing of Saeran Naïlo, Sidhion's heart thudded painfully and he schooled his expression. Saeran had followed him. He gave a false smile of joviality. "Saeran. Is there a problem?"
	</p><p>"You tell me," Saeran said, unfazed by Sidhion's fake smile. "You're acting off," he said pointedly. <i>You cannot hide from me. Tell me what is going on.</i>
	</p><p>Sidhion looked down. Was now a proper time? He had Saeran alone, and inquiring about his woes. He figured now was as good a time as any. His throat went dry, and his hands twitched. He blew out a sigh, and motioned for Saeran to come stand near him. "Actually, I need to talk to you about something. And I'd appreciate it if you would consider things before you say anything. That is all I ask." <i>Take as long as you need.</i> He hoped Saeran would understand. Reciprocate, probably not. But not drop his hand of friendship in disgust. Oh Gods, not that.
	</p><p><i>Oh, it's a girl,</i> Saeran thought, trying not to smirk. He moved closer to his friend, doing his best to show Sidhion in his eyes that he was worth being trusted with secrets (which may or not have been true, depending on the juiciness of the secret). He desperately wanted to know what it was that had his friend choking and running away. "Alright. I will listen."
	</p><p>Sidhion wished the words would come as easily to him as they came to Saeran. Because this was a delicate matter. This could cause a dynamic shift in the nature of their relationship. Saeran looked as trustworthy as he did any day. But he also clearly wanted to hear what Sidhion had to say. "Lately I've become aware of a particular... attachment I've grown to possess. It's something that's very new to me, but looking at it now, it makes perfect sense. And I need to confront it or I fear I shall lose myself." He paused so that he could stop his rambling. His fingers were numb now, but he brought up a hands anyway. Here it went. Things would never be the same. He touched Saeran's cheek like it was made of porcelain and peered into his dazzling eyes. "I.. have feelings for you, Saeran."
	</p><p>Saeran had smirked eagerly to hear his predictions be verified, but his smile faded when Sidhion said an unexpected set of words. Saeran was sure he hadn't heard correctly. "You..." he swallowed. The hand on his cheek felt uncomfortably warm, as did the entire night. He was frozen in place, unable to believe what his only friend had confided in him. No, this couldn't be right. He'd seen Sidhion around girls. They loved him. And Saeran himself, he was not... Saeran's eyes became clear as it all made sense. Of course Sidhion hadn't meant it. It was a trick. A game. <i>Clever boy.</i> He'd been lured out here for a practical joke, and he'd almost fallen for it. But Sidhion's movements were too bold and his claim just too outrageous. As if he was supposed to believe Sidhion was in love with him. <i>He's trying to make me uncomfortable.</i> He'd be damned if it wasn't working, but Saeran suddenly knew that he could turn the tables on Sidhion. He hated losing at these little pranks. Saeran would make Sidhion even more uncomfortable.
	</p><p>Saeran forged a sigh of relief and clapped a hand to Sidhion's, against his cheek. "Oh Sidhion... I'm so glad you finally said it."
	</p><p>Sidhion nearly jumped out of his skin. He had been waiting for something awful to happen. A slap. Or even more hurtful words thrown in his face. And instead, Saeran seemed.. pleased. And his hand was being pressed even more forcefully into the soft flesh of his beloved's cheek. And Saeran was smiling at him. And it was all so unreal there was no way it could actually be happening. Sidhion's entire body seemed to exhale. He rubbed along Saeran's cheek with his thumb. "Then.. then you feel the same way? Oh, you don't know how tormented I've been." It all made sense now. A connection like theirs couldn’t possibly be one-sided. He wondered how long he'd made Saeran wait. He'd been so foolish. He should have been out with it from the get go. "Why didn't you tell me?"
	</p><p>This would be a challenging game to win, Saeran knew as his cheek was brushed affectionately. "I was terrified. How could someone like you love someone like me?" he said, in the same sweet voice that worked so well on ladies. He grinned at Sidhion, as if to say, 'You better believe I'm not backing down from this.'
	</p><p>Sidhion's eyes softened. "Fool." He fluidly moved in and wrapped his arms around Sidhion's waist, holding him closer to his heart. "You're a much better man than I." He said, with all the passion he'd ever felt in his short life of seventy-one years, and leaned his head onto Saeran's shoulder. This felt so right. And it was okay now, because he'd confessed, and Saeran had as well, and now they could simply be together. He giggled in his bliss.
	</p><p><i>Oh, you're the fool, Stilmyst.</i> Saeran thought as he returned the embrace. It was too intimate for his liking, but it was yet too early in the game to give in. He only held him firmer. And that little giggle was much too over-the-top. He didn't believe it for a second. "Come to my house tonight," Saeran whispered into his ear, in a voice he was sure could make Sidhion's face pale.
	</p><p>Sidhion shuddered, and all the color bled out of his face. Did Saeran really just-? It was much too soon for anything… wasn't it? And yet the thought of spending the night with Saeran, even just embracing each other in bed, was something he couldn't- and wouldn't- pass up for the world. Besides, it's not like this was all that new anyway. They'd known each other since they were born, and they had both clearly felt the same way for a while. So it wasn't really so large a jump after all. "Okay…" he whispered back at last, his cheeks now tinged with pink. He looked at Saeran's face adoringly. <i>You can have whatever you want of me.</i>
	</p><p>Saeran was somewhat impressed by his friend's commitment, but he knew Sidhion was losing strength. He took a step back, hands on his friend's waist. "What's wrong? We've had sleepovers before," Saeran said coyly. He leaned in close and touched foreheads with Sidhion. "You're flushed. Why, I could just eat you up," he muttered with a smirk.
	</p><p>The very implications of that statement… and he was sure Saeran knew just how provocative it sounded. With a sharp intake of breath, he tried to swallow, but was unable to. "N-nothing is wrong." <i>Everything's right. It's too much.</i> "I'll come over." He closed his eyes and simply felt Saeran's hands upon him, Saeran's skin on his. He stifled a tremor at it all. "Y-you're doing things to me..." <i>when you say things like that.</i>
	</p><p>Saeran tutted. "I'm sorry, Sidhion. Am I making you uncomfortable? Is it too much?" Saeran asked with a smirk. <i>That's right. I win.</i>
	</p><p>And Sidhion was on fire. He needed to try harder to match Saeran's level of passion. It wasn't fair of him to confess and start this between them without being equally as committed. So he trailed the hands on Saeran's sides slowly upward, nuzzling his cheek and whispering in his ear. "Please." He could take it all in stride. "There's so much more I'd like to do to you."
	</p><p>Saeran's heart fell through his stomach as he lost the upper hand. He cleared his throat again to maintain composure, but Sidhion's breath tickled his ear and made him nearly want to call it quits. If he could hold off until they returned to Naïlo Manor, maybe Sidhion's resolve would weaken. "Shh." Saeran said, taking a brisk step back and pressing a finger to Sidhion's lips. "Save it for my bedroom."
	</p><p>Taking Saeran's hand in his, Sidhion kissed his finger sensually. He smirked. "I'll see you there."  The fire was quickly traveling south and he couldn't wait to get to the Nailo household. Running a finger along Saeran's jaw as he'd wanted to all night, he said warmly. "Wait up for me." At last he tore himself away from his Saeran and stepped back. "I'll go fetch my parents.."
	</p><p>Saeran nodded stiffly, forcing himself to maintain composure until Sidhion left the patio, at which point he nearly collapsed over the railing with a shudder. His hand felt soiled. Saeran reassured himself by thinking that Sidhion's touches and remarks were mere teases. They must have worked wonders on the girls at Lamara, because even he felt flushed. But Sidhion would falter soon enough, if he just kept up the bluff. Taking in a deep breath of fresh air for confidence, Saeran righted his posture and re-entered the dining hall.
	</p><p>The walk home didn't seem long enough. Saeran avoided eye contact with his brother after the embarrassing exchange on the patio at dinner. Tyson didn't want to talk about what he deemed  "fancy stuff" anyway. According to their mother's disposition, he had done something terribly wrong after Saeran left. Saeran didn't really care what. He just hoped no one would walk into his room tonight.
	</p><p>Tyson was very grumpy. He couldn't believe his luck. He hadn't said anything to anyone. Just sat in the same chair the entire night. And Saeran wouldn't even look at him, which was just as well. But by the time they reached their estate, with no one talking, it was much too silent for his taste. "Where did you go?" he asked Saeran once their went to a different room.
	</p><p>Saeran waved off his brother's question. "Oh, nowhere," he said, but his ears turned back ever so slightly. The truth of the matter was far too difficult to explain, and he didn't want Tyson to misunderstand. "After finding out about the dewmead subsidy, I needed some fresh air."
	</p><p>Fancy talk. Tyson turned up his nose and walked to his room. He didn't need this.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Sidhion was on cloud nine, and his parents noticed. However the only explanation he offered was that he was going to stay the night at the Naïlo’s. Which his parents were more than happy about. Their son was great at making ties with the other young nobles. If only he were better friends with little Vira… Sidhion had rushed them home and twirled Phantyni in a dance in the kitchen. Then he grabbed a set of clothing and kissed their cheeks before he flew out the door and all but ran to the Saeran's home. He was nervous and excited all at once, but he knew Saeran was probably feeling the same way. So it was fine. They would figure this out together. Luckily they only lived five minutes away from each other. The perks of living in the upper district.
	</p><p>Sidhion reached the household in record time and caught his breath out front. He almost couldn't sort out his hair because his fingers were shaking so much. Then he approached the door and knocked. The longer he stood and waited, the harder it was to breathe.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p> With a sigh Saeran retired to his room. Tyson had departed with such an air that Saeran was glad their mother would obviously be talking to him later. Sidhion would be here soon to continue their battle of wills. He undid his ascot and a couple of the higher buttons on his doublet, when all too quickly there was a knock at the door. He'd explained to his parents that Sidhion would be over, but it was still probably best for him to answer the door rather than a servant. Sidhion might try to raise the stakes by letting slip something humiliating to another elf in his home. So he slid lazily down the stairs and opened the front door with a sly smile. "Sidhion."
	</p><p>Sidhion grinned, immediately noticing where Saeran's shirt was slightly unbuttoned before he bowed gracefully and was welcomed in. "I missed you," he teased, mostly serious. He eagerly stepped closer to his friend, his fingers sliding from Saeran's deliciously bare collarbone downward. "Now that we've shared with each other, it's difficult to be away…"
	</p><p>Saeran leaned back jerked his head around the foyer to double check that is was empty. Thankfully it was. Saeran grabbed him by the forearm, pointedly ending contact on his chest, and pulled him out of the doorway to shut the door. "I wouldn't want you to catch cold," Saeran joked. Then he looked intensely into Sidhion's eyes. "Come to my room with me," <i>and out of this room where others might look on our game and misunderstand.</i> "Please." he added sensually.
	</p><p><i>Forceful.</i> Sidhion's heart leapt. The smoldering look Saeran was giving him, the hand that had so assertively taken his. At Saeran's 'please', his knees almost buckled out from underneath him. His body temperature doubled. He then smiled seductively and laced his fingers through Saeran's. "You can have whatever you like if you say it like that," he said in a hushed tone. He pulled Saeran up the steps he'd traversed a thousand times to Saeran's bedroom laughing merrily.
	</p><p>Saeran turned his face away to hide a gag. Sidhion had apparently gained resolve since they left the dinner party. Saeran didn't want Sidhion to know, but he'd never even held a girl's hand the way he was holding Sidhion's now. He realized then that Sidhion was more experienced, and would probably have no trouble moving in for a kiss, even if he KNEW it would be Saeran's first. That thought made the hair on Saeran's neck stand up. It could be that he was outmatched in this game.
	</p><p>Saeran yanked Sidhion into his room and slowly shut the door, looking over his shoulder at his friend. He latched the door and raised an eyebrow.
	</p><p>"Oh." At the click, Sidhion flinched. <i> Gods, gods, gods...</i> He tried to act confident. So he hadn't done anything like this before, so what? Neither had Saeran. Sidhion was older, but Saeran seemed to want to be in control, if the way he had handled his arm was any indication. He moved toward the bed and sat down on the edge, looking at Saeran expectantly. <i>Come here..</i>
	</p><p>Saeran started to sweat when Sidhion came and plainly sat on the bed. <i>Not subtle.</i> He walked over to Sidhion, without breaking eye contact, and put a hand on his chest to push him down.
	</p><p>Sidhion was now sprawled on Saeran's bed, Saeran standing over him, and he was overcome with nervousness yet again and he visibly swallowed, trying to rise back up onto his elbows with Saeran's hand still on his chest. Something about being here in this position.. "S-Saeran.." <i>This is too fast. This is TOO FAST.</i> They'd only just accepted everything hours ago, and they had the rest of their lives to progress. Would Saeran be upset if he-?
	</p><p>Saeran tilted his head with a smirk. Victory was within grasp. "Yes, my love?" he said as he moved one knee onto the bed. <i>Give up, Sidhion. I've got you beaten.</i>
	</p><p><i>He knows exactly what he's doing.</i> Sidhion thought with a shudder. "We might be.." Would he really regret this in the morning? Maybe not. He shook his head. <i>This is fine.</i> He licked his lips and leaned up to grab Saeran's shoulders, pulling him down so he was hovering above him. "Never mind," he spoke staring into Saeran's eyes with every bit of longing and desire he had kept hidden. He entangled one of his legs with Saeran's and put a hand on Saeran's lovely cheek, playing with the well-groomed tresses.
	</p><p>Saeran barely caught himself he was so surprised by Sidhion's sudden change of manner. Suddenly they were both on the bed and Sidhion was licking his lips. Saeran struggled to maintain composure. He couldn't understand why a moment ago Sidhion looked ready to run home, and now the look in his eyes was nothing but confident. Saeran was trapped. He couldn't back away now. Even if he was ready to cave, Sidhion had wrapped a leg around him. Saeran wanted to back away and convince Sidhion to stop, stop holding him and staring at him, but that would be failure. The unspoken rule of the game was that they had to advance closer each round, and it was Saeran's turn. He had no choice but to slowly lower himself on his arms. He couldn't look Sidhion in the eye without revealing how uncomfortable he was, so he looked at the lips that he had to approach. Carefully.
	</p><p>Sidhion's heart was throbbing in his chest, in his head. Never in his wildest dreams.. He wished Saeran would look at him, but he was staring at his lips longingly, and he supposed that was good enough. He closed his eyes and moved up to press his lips softly to to Saeran's.
	</p><p>With Sidhion's hand on his cheek and the bed beneath them, Saeran was confident the situation was too intimate for Sidhion. But then he closed his eyes. Saeran assured himself it was only a bluff, and continued his descent. <i>I'm gonna do it, Sidhion. I will. So stop. Stop. STOP.</i> Saeran started to panic. He wouldn't dare kiss him, right? Right?? They touched noses, and Saeran faltered. He couldn't move any closer, but Sidhion still was... 
	</p><p>Time slowed and Saeran's heart stopped. Sidhion's pursed lips brushed his, ever so slightly, but it sent such energy through Saeran's body that he shivered, and finally he moved away with a sigh of defeat. 
	</p><p>The second their lips touched, fire coursed through Sidhion's veins and pools in his heart and his stomach and told him this was where he was meant to be. If he had any inhibitions before, they were gone now. He finally found someone who he belonged with, his search was over, and he smiled in bliss when all too soon, the feelings were ripped away. Saeran pulled back. Why..?
	</p><p>Saeran straightened his arms and hung his head, unable to look in his friend's face.
	</p><p>	Was he shy? Sidhion's heart stopped. Did he change his mind? Sidhion had messed something up and now Saeran wanted nothing to do with- 
	</p><p>"Fine, you win." Saeran chuckled with relief. At least it was over now.
	</p><p>The words rung through Sidhion's head. For Tina's sake, it just didn't make any SENSE. He felt cold. "…What?" he asked softly, confused beyond belief, but with an inkling of understanding that he refused to accept from fact until he heard it uttered from Saeran's lips. Saeran's soft, warm, unbelievably PERFECT lips.
	</p><p>Saeran was ashamed. He hated losing, but Sidhion was the stronger man in this respect. He briskly pushed Sidhion's leg away and got back to his feet. "You win." he muttered again. Just like Sidhion to further embarrass him by forcing Saeran to repeat the statement of his defeat. "I can't do it. So good job."
	</p><p>As a master of reading Saeran, and a surprisingly introspective elf besides, it dawned on him (even in his emotionally drawn and hormonally charged state) that this had all been one big game to Saeran. He had thought they were joking. He had though Sidhion's confession was a joke. He was crestfallen. He should have known. He fell so easily into it. Wishful thinking. And now he had the humiliating revelation that he was lying on Saeran's bed, desperate and lusting like some whore for a man that didn't have any more feelings for him than he did for his snotty younger brother. He sat up, hanging his head with his eyes closed and swinging his legs off the side. After a minute of silence he turned smiled at Saeran, his eyes carefully guarded. "Fool. And I thought you could win any challenge." It wasn't the first time they had played a daredevil game. It was simply the first time Saeran had lost. And the first time Sidhion hadn't realized that were playing. He hoped Saeran couldn't see the sheen over his eyes. He needed to leave. The room had become suffocating and taunting and he couldn't hear anything other than Saeran's proclamation.
	</p><p>Saeran ran his fingers through his hair and shuddered a sigh of relief. That game was getting much too intense for him before he finally caved. They'd nearly... Saeran felt his ears heat up and he sat on the side of the bed, a few inches from his friend. At least now they could have a normal evening together.
	</p><p>"Well you finally got me, I suppose." he said with a smirk. He looked at Sidhion again. He didn't look quite as happy as he should, having completely bested Saeran for the first time. His commitment to the game was so absolute that there were moment when Saeran wondered if... He shook his head and looked away. "Well then. Now that that's over, we can discuss the event at dinner this evening. I'm not sure if you noticed the tension between Fellmir and the king tonight..."
	</p><p>Sidhion didn't hear a thing Saeran said.. He stared at his knees as he spoke up suddenly. "What if it hadn't been a game?" he nearly whispered. "What if I really had feelings for you?" He turned and looked at Saeran then. "Would you hate me? Would you wish to never see me again?"
	</p><p>Saeran was cut off. He thought for a second about what Sidhion said and scoffed at the thought. "If you were serious?" He met Sidhion's eyes with his own careless gaze and was taken aback by the intensity in his friend's expression. It was just a game. Right? Were those...tears? "Sidhion... What are you saying?" In this moment Saeran's calculating mind had completely failed to make sense of the situation. There was no sensible explanation.
	</p><p>Sidhion's expression hardened for a second. Then fell again. He buried his head in his knees and wrapped his arms around them. The next part he did whisper. He half hoped Saeran wouldn't hear, because he was afraid of what he would say in response. But he knew that he would, and he knew that Saeran needed to. "That I am serious." He tensed.
	</p><p>Saeran had been concerned for a moment at Sidhion's obvious distress. Then he heard the apparent reason why, and the world crashed around his ears that had been listening so carefully.
	</p><p>"You're... what?"
	</p><p>Sidhion. Feelings for him. It hadn't been a game. Saeran stood up from the bed quickly, backing away from the spot where Sidhion was curled up. Oh how he'd embarrassed himself. It wasn't a game. He'd told a boy that he loved him and gotten him alone and pushed him on the bed and nearly kissed him. Saeran's face turned red. He raised a hand, shaking with rage, to his mouth. "What... what have you done?" Saeran seethed. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand, glaring at Sidhion. "We were perfect! You ruined everything," he hissed.
	</p><p>Sidhion heard all the words he had expected to hear. Watched him rub away Sidhion's touch and very essence he'd so lovingly left upon him. And somehow it still stung worse than he ever thought it could. It didn't matter if he was rich and handsome and cunning and generous, and all the girls wished he would look their way. It didn't matter that he'd been Saeran's only true friend since the time he was born. Because now he was worthless. Now he was sickening. Saeran didn't want any part of him. And he rejected Sidhion's heart, the purest part of him. He felt broken. He WAS broken.
	</p><p>He looked at Saeran glumly, the light in his eyes all but vanished. "I did." With that he stood and, grabbing the clothing he'd set on the ground, flipped open the lock and left.
	</p><p>Saeran strode over and slammed the door after him. Sidhion left before he could demand that he do so. Saeran felt, more than betrayed or violated, bitter. For so long he had a friend, a companion. Sidhion had meant a lot to him, he realized. But not like THAT. He'd lost his only confidant, and it stung so much. He was furious. It's all your fault. his head screamed, glaring at the door. To think that they'd embraced. Held hands. Saeran spat at the ground and turned away. All he could do was storm around his room and pull at his hair in frustration. How dare Sidhion put him in this position. He spent the night in his room, furious, humiliated, and most of all, alone.

	<p>Sidhion scampered down the steps, unable to see more than blurs of color, but his muscle memory of the Nailo household orchestrating his movements. He was moving through the second parlor toward the exit when he slammed fully into something.. someONE. Falling back and landing awkwardly, he rubbed his eyes and looked in front of him to see Tyson staring down at him confusedly.
	</p><p>"Sidhion?" His eyes seemed to be peeling Sidhion's skin away. "My brother should be in his bedroom, if you're looking for him," he said politely, as etiquette had been his two hour lesson from his parents as punishment. At the name, Sidhion gasped in pain. Tyson looked worried.
	</p><p>"I need to.. go.." Sidhion managed- he was DYING- and he scrambled to his feet and ran past Tyson out through the door.
	</p><p>He didn't know what had happened or when Sidhion had arrived, but he wondered idly if Saeran was the cause. He shrugged. None of his business. Then he continued on his quest (to go find some feral Holimion bunnies).
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Sidhion stared at his ceiling as he lie on his bed. His eyes were wet. Would he cry? That wouldn't change anything. Self pity wouldn't make Saeran return his feelings or even return his friendship. He wiped his eyes. No, he was Sidhion Stylmist! He sat up suddenly. Holimion wasn't built in a day. Stylmist Woodworks took centuries to culminate. Heck, even the spells he had begun learning took months to master, at least. And he KNEW it wouldn't be that easy to win the heart of Saeran Naïlo. But that didn't mean it couldn't be done. He grinned optimistically.
	</p><p>He would simply have to show Saeran that he was worth falling in love with.
	</p><p>And he would spend as long as he needed to.
