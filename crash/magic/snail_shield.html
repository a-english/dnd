	<h1>Snail Shield</h1>
	<img src="carapace_cuffs.png">
	<p>Shield constructed from the shell of a Flail Snail. Like all shields, it increases your AC by 2. For 32 days, it provides the Antimagic Shell trait.</p>

	<p><b>Antimagic Shell.</b> You have advantage on Reflex saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll as long as you are not surprised. If you succeed on your saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses you, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d6:</p>

	 <p><b>1–2.</b> If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only you, it has no effect on the snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the <b>spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.</b></p>

	 <p><b>3–4.</b> No additional effect.</p>

	 <p><b>5–6.</b> The shield converts some of the spell’s energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature <b>within 30 feet</b> of the weilder of the bracers must make a <b>DC 15 Constitution saving throw</b>, taking <b>1d6 force damage per level of the spell</b> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
