	<p>Bracers constructed from the shell of a Flail Snail. For 32 days, they provide the Antimagic Shell trait.</p>

	<p><b>Antimagic Shell.</b> You have advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll as long as you are not surprised. If you succeed on your saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses you, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d6:</p>

	 <p><b>1–2.</b> If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only you, it has no effect on the snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the <b>spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.</b></p>

	 <p><b>3–4.</b> No additional effect.</p>

	 <p><b>5–6.</b> The cuffs converts some of the spell’s energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature <b>within 30 feet</b> of the weilder of the cuffs must make a <b>DC 15 Constitution saving throw</b>, taking <b>1d6 force damage per level of the spell</b> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
