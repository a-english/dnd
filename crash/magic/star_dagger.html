	<h1>Dagger of Shooting Stars</h1>
	<img src="star_dagger.png">
	<p>This finely-wrought dagger appeared at a mysterious shrine after wishing upon a star.</p>
	
	<p>Like all daggers it is a finesse weapon that can be thrown or used to stab for <b>1d4</b> damage, plus either your Strength or Dexterity.</p>

	<p>Once per day, it can be used to cast Magic Missile as a first-level spell. You create <b>three</b> glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within <b>120ft</b>. A dart deals <b>1d4+1 force damage</b> to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. </p>
