	<h1>Staff of Charming</h1>
	<img src="staff_of_charming.png">
	<p>This staff was recovered from the satyr prince's palace deep within the Feywild. It can only be attuned to by a bard, cleric, druid, sorceror, warlock, or wizard.</p>
	<p>While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend some of it <b>10 charges</b> to cast a spell using <b>your spell save DC</b>.

		<p>The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff. Like all quarterstaffs, it is a <b>versatile</b> weapon that deals <b>1d6</b> bludgeoning damage when wielded with one hand, or <b>1d8</b> when wielded with two. </p>
		<p>If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment wpell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.</p>
		<p>The staff regains 1d8+2 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
