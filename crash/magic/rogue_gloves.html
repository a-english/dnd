	<p>These gloves are light to the touch and fit closely with the skin. These gloves were crafted to honor Puck, and then ironically stolen. </p>

	<p>Wearing these gloves somehow makes you feel like you can do anything. When wearing these gloves, you gain a <b>+5 to Dexterity checks for Sleight of Hand and picking locks</b>. These gloves are also <b>invisible when worn</b>.With every mischievous deed committed, the wearer seems to hear pan flutes in the distance.
