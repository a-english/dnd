<h2>Jennessa's Apothecary</h2>
<p>
An inviting place just outside the college, this little shop has windows teeming with plants and colorful vials. Inside, an inviting storefront has a counter and room to sit while you wait for your order. Behind the storefront is a staircase leading up and down, as well as part of the living space for the residents of this little shop; a kitchen and a dining room. Behind the counter there's a back exit, where the horses are kept.</p>
<p>
In the basement is where potions are brewed. A full chemist's set, with all its beakers and burners, accompanies a churning cauldron over a bed of ever-burning fire chips. Nearby is the storage room, where all manner of oddities are kept safe behind its doors.
</p>
<p>Upstairs is the witch's bedroom, and a room for her ward as well. The third room, could be a bedroom, but as it is is simply teeming with books of all sorts.
