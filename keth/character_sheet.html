			<li> <strong>Maneuvering Attack</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one o f your com rades into a more advantageous position.

			<li> <strong>Disarming Attack</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding.
